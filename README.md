# spaghetto bot
Spaghetto bot is a simple and a fun python bot working on [PTB library](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot).

It's goal is to give a user a chance to roll the dice which will give them a random number from -5 to 15. This number will then be added to user's initial value and be stored in database linked to user's Telegram ID and their name. The numbers are also linked to user's fictional height, so it's a competition to get as high as possible.

Current version only includes Russian language, but the support for other languages can be implemented later on. Current version doesn't include a lot of comments because of the amount of boilerplate code.
